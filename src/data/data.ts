Written by Lewis Carrol, the book was published in 1865 and it quickly became one of the most popular works of English-language fiction. The story centers around a young girl named Alice, who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows the White Rabbit down a rabbit hole. She has many astonishing, often extraordinary adventures with thoroughly illogical and strange creatures. Alice often changes in size unexpectedly as she grows as tall as a house and shrinks to 3 inches in another part of the book.The story was originally told by Carroll to Alice, Lorins, and Edith Liddell; Henry George Liddell’s daughters on a picnic in July 1862. Alice asked Carroll to write out the stories for her to which he responded by giving her a hand-lettered collection titled Alice’s Adventures Under Ground. A visitor visited the Liddell home, saw the Storybook and advised Carroll to publish it. Carroll revised the hand letters, expanded them and this classic was born.The book appeared at a time when children’s literature was generally about teaching moral lessons. Critics were harsh on the book and failed to appreciate the nonsense that so captivated young children. But Carrol understood how children’s minds worked, and the way he turned logic on its head appealed to them. The work gained so much popularity, leading Carroll to write consequent books in the series like “Through the Looking-Glass, and “What Alice Found There.” The book has also inspired numerous theatrical performances, ballets, and films.",
